import time
import RPi.GPIO as GP
Set the pins in the RPI
Set GPIO pin mode to BCM numbering

NOW To find the distance of the object using sensor 1:
  Set avgDistance=0
  Loop for i in range(5):
  Set GPIO output as (TRIG, False)
  Set time.sleep() as 0.1

  Set GPIO output as (TRIG, True)
  Set time.sleep() as (0.00001)
  GPIO.output(TRIG, False)

  loop while GPIO.input(ECHO)==0:
       Set GPIO output (led, False)
  Set pulse_start as time.time()

  Loop while GPIO.input(ECHO) is equal to 1:
      #Check whether the ECHO is HIGH
       Set GPIO outputas (led, False) 
  Set pulse_end as time.time()
  Set pulse_duration as pulse_end - pulse_start

  Set distance as pulse_duration * 17150
  Set distance as round(distance,2)
  Set avgDistance1 as avgDistance+distance

Similarly we will find the distance for sensor 2
 Now:
 if avgDistance1 is equal to avgDistance2:
    set count as count+1
    Apply stop()
    Set time.sleep() as 1
    Apply back()
    Set time.sleep() as (1.5)
    if (count%3 is equal to 1) and (flag is equal to 0):
     Apply right()
     Set flag as 1
    else:
     Apply left()
     Set flag as 0
    Set time.sleep() as (1.5)
    Apply stop()
    Set time.sleep() as (1)
