# Plasbot
To cleanse the water bodies of plastic waste both of floating and underwater nature thus leading to various benefits such as cleaner environment for the aquatic flora and fauna.

1.	Background of the problem
Water is one of the most essential resources that almost every species on earth needs and should save every drop of it. But on the other hand, water pollution is increasing day by day in water bodies and it is very difficult for marine life to survive also there is less fresh water available for consumption. From a study, approximately 165 million tons of plastic wastes were estimated to be present in the oceans of the world. Typically, plastics in the oceans can degrade within a year but not completely. During this plastic degradation process, toxic chemicals like polystyrene and BPA can be released into the water causing water pollution. Wastes found in the oceans are made up of approximately 80% plastics. Hence it is needed to separate/filter water from the garbage/plastics present in it.

2.	Scope of the problem
As we all know that only 0.5-1% of the total water available on earth is fresh water and we are also polluting that water also by throwing plastic garbage in rivers, lakes etc. Plastics not only pollutes the water but also kills the marine life present in it. Hence, we have found a way to separate the plastic garbage from the water bodies by the means of a robot ‘PlasBot’ which can collect plastic garbage from both under and over water. We used different methodologies and many solutions and came to a conclusion to build the Bot which will clean the plastic waste from water bodies and very beneficial for aquatic flora and fauna. We also designed it in a way so that it is efficient, minimum wastage and minimum use of manpower. The beneficiaries will be both governmental as well as non-governmental organizations who are working towards cleaning of oceans, rivers, etc.


3.	Design philosophy used in this report 
In this report, we first briefly discussed about our problems, various solution methodologies for them, beneficiaries and why we chose to build it. After that we identified different products which were already in the market, similar to our product and their comparison with our product. Next, we discussed how we narrowed down to our one product from various different products through rigorous analysis. After that, the detailed design of our product, explaining each part of the product was done. At last, the budget analysis was done considering various constraints like the maximum amount to be used, minimum wastage etc.,
4.	Problem statement 
To cleanse the water bodies of plastic waste both of floating and underwater nature thus leading to various benefits such as cleaner environment for the aquatic flora and fauna.

5.	Beneficiaries (Intended market)
Cleaning the water bodies is one of the major problems. If we could arrive at an efficient solution, it will directly solve a lot of major environmental issues. So PlasBot is intended for the use of various governmental as well as non-governmental organizations who are working towards cleaning of oceans, rivers, etc. thus solving the issue of plastic present inside water. PlasBot would help the organizations to efficiently tackle the problem of plastic present inside water which is one of the major concerns related to the environment.
